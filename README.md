![Dashboard Preview](preview.png)
## Project Overview
This project was completed during my internship at **Future Intern**. The goal was to analyze Facebook marketing data to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), track ROI, and optimize ad spend across different demographics.

## Key Features
- **Corrected ROI Calculation:** Fixed a common Power BI error where ROI was summing to 9900%; now accurately reflects campaign performance (e.g., 198.2%).
- **Interactive Slicers:** Allows filtering by Age, Gender, and Campaign ID.
- **Trend Analysis:** A daily spending trend line to monitor campaign pacing.
- **Demographic Insights:** Bar charts showing which age groups yield the highest conversions.

## Tech Stack
- **Power BI:** Data visualization and DAX modeling.
- **Excel/CSV:** Data sourcing and cleaning.

## Insights
- The **30-34 age group** is the most efficient, delivering the highest ROI.
- Daily spend peaks correlate directly with high conversion volumes, suggesting our current bidding strategy is effective.
